        <p>Hi, my name is Muffins. I am a 
        mighty cat. I was adopted by my family 
        when I was only three weeks old.</p>
        <p>My new mommy is a human. They are 
        funny creatures. </p>
        <p>I left the pound with my new mommy and 
        new sister, Maria. They took me straight to 
        the pet store to buy:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
            <li>A small cloth toy</li>
            <li>Litter box with litter</li>
            <li>Food (for later)</li>
        
        </ul>

        <p>
            Mom and sis had to feed me with a bottle 
            because I was so young.
