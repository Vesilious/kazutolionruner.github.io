Welcome to the internet <br/>
Have a look around <br/>

Some better, some worse <br/>
If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first <br/>

There's no need to panic <br/>
This isn't a test [*laughs*] <br/>
Just nod or shake your head and we'll do the rest <br/>
 <br/>
Welcome to the internet <br/>
What would you prefer: <br/>
Would you like to fight for civil rights <br/>
Or tweet a racial slur <br/>
Be happy <br/>
Be horny <br/>
Be bursting with rage <br/>
We got a million different ways to engage <br/>
 <br/>
Welcome to the internet <br/>
Put your cares aside <br/>

Here's a nine-year-old who died <br/>
We got movies, and doctors, and fantasy sports <br/>
And a bunch of colored pencil drawings of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other! Welcome to the internet! <br/>
 <br/>
Hold on to your socks <br/>
'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock <br/>
They are grainy and off-putting <br/>
He just sent you more <br/>
Don't act surprised <br/>
You know you like it, you whore <br/>
 <br/>
See a man beheaded <br/>
Get offended, see a shrink <br/>
Show us pictures of your children <br/>
Tell us every thought you think <br/>
 <br/>
Start a rumor, buy a broom <br/>
Or send a death threat to a boomer <br/>
Or DM a girl and groom her <br/>
Do a Zoom or find a tumor <br/>
And here's a healthy breakfast option <br/>

 <br/>
Here's why women never fu*kyou <br/>
Here's how you can build a bomb <br/>

Take this quirky quiz <br/>
Obama sent the immigrants <br/>
To vaccinate your kids <br/>
 <br/>
Could I interest you in everything <br/>
All of the time? <br/>
A little bit of everything <br/>
All of the time <br/>
Apathy's a tragedy <br/>
And boredom is a crime <br/>
Anything and everything <br/>
All of the time <br/>
 <br/>
Could I interest you in everything <br/>
All of the time? <br/>
A little bit of everything <br/>
All of the time <br/>

You know, it wasn't always like this <br/>
 <br/>
Not very long ago <br/>
Just before your time <br/>
Right before the towers fell <br/>
Circa '99 <br/>
 <br/>
This was catalogs <br/>
Travel blogs <br/>
A chat room or two <br/>
We set our sights and spent our nights <br/>
Waiting <br/>
For you <br/>
You <br/>
Insatiable you <br/>
Mommy let you use her iPad <br/>
You were barely two <br/>
And it did all the things <br/>
We designed it to do <br/>
 <br/>
Now look at you <br/>
Oh <br/>
 <br/>
Look at you <br/>
You, you <br/>
Unstoppable, watchable <br/>
Your time is now <br/>
Your inside's out <br/>
Honey, how you grew <br/>
And if we stick together <br/>
Who knows what we'll do <br/>
It was always the plan <br/>
To put the world in your hand <br/>
 <br/>
[*laughing hysterically*] <br/>
 <br/>
Could I interest you in everything <br/>
All of the time <br/>
A bit of everything <br/>
All of the time <br/>
Apathy's a tragedy <br/>
And boredom is a crime <br/>
Anything and everything <br/>
All of the time <br/>
 <br/>
Could I interest you in everything <br/>
All of the time <br/>
A bit of everything <br/>
All of the time <br/>
Apathy's a tragedy <br/>
And boredom is a crime <br/>
Anything and everything <br/>
And anything and everything <br/>
And anything and everything <br/>
And all of the time <br/>
